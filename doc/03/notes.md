# 📌 Notes

## 🔹 What is an API Response?
An **API response** is what the server sends back after a client request.  
It usually contains:
- **HTTP Status Code** → outcome of the request.  
- **Headers** → metadata like `Content-Type`, caching, etc.  
- **Body (payload)** → the actual data (JSON, XML, text, etc.).

# 📌 Problem Details (RFC 7807)

## 🔹 What is Problem Details?
**Problem Details** is a standardized format for representing API errors in a consistent way.  

Instead of returning different error objects for each endpoint, you always return a **structured JSON response**.

---

## 🔹 Why Use Problem Details?
- ✅ **Consistency** → All errors follow the same structure.  
- ✅ **Machine-friendly** → Clients can parse fields like `status` and `type`.  
- ✅ **Extensible** → You can add extra fields (`errors`, `traceId`).  
- ✅ **Standards-based** → Widely supported, based on an official RFC.  

---

###  🔹Standard JSON Format Example
```json
{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/validation-error",
  "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The Name field is required.",
  "instance": "/users/123"
}
```

---

## 🔹 Common HTTP Status Codes

### ✅ Success
- **200 OK** → Request succeeded, returns data.  
- **201 Created** → Resource successfully created (often with `Location` header).  
- **202 Accepted** → Request accepted, but still processing.  
- **204 No Content** → Success, but no body returned (e.g., DELETE).  

### ⚠️ Client Errors
- **400 Bad Request** → Invalid request (bad JSON, missing field, etc.).  
- **401 Unauthorized** → Authentication required / invalid credentials.  
- **403 Forbidden** → Authenticated, but not allowed.  
- **404 Not Found** → Resource doesn’t exist.  
- **409 Conflict** → Conflict with current state (duplicate, version issue).  

### ❌ Server Errors
- **500 Internal Server Error** → Unexpected server failure.  
- **502 Bad Gateway** → Invalid response from upstream service.  
- **503 Service Unavailable** → Service overloaded or down.  
- **504 Gateway Timeout** → Server didn’t respond in time.

# 📌 FluentValidation – Comprehensive Notes

## 🔹 What is FluentValidation?
**FluentValidation** is a .NET library used to create **validation rules for objects, commands, or DTOs** in a clean, readable, and maintainable way.  

Key points:
- Uses **fluent, chainable syntax** for defining rules.  
- Keeps **validation logic separate from business logic**.  
- Integrates with **ASP.NET Core**, **Minimal API**, **MediatR**, and MVC.  
- Supports **complex rules, nested objects, and collections**.  
- Works well with **ProblemDetails** and **Swagger/OpenAPI** for standardized error responses.

---

## 🔹 Why Use FluentValidation?
- ✅ **Readable and maintainable** – easy to understand rules.  
- ✅ **Reusable** – one validator can be used in multiple endpoints or handlers.  
- ✅ **Consistent error structure** – integrates well with standardized API error formats.  
- ✅ **Extensible** – supports custom error messages, conditions, and complex logic.  
- ✅ **Separation of concerns** – validation is not mixed with business logic.
